# Rock vs Mine Classification

This project demonstrates the use of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify sonar data. The sonar dataset contains information about objects detected underwater, categorized as either "Rock" or "Mine" based on their acoustic properties. 

The notebook provides an end-to-end implementation, from data loading to model evaluation, and includes visualizations and performance metrics for better understanding.

## Dataset

The sonar dataset contains 208 samples, each with 60 attributes representing frequency bands. The goal is to predict whether a given sample represents a rock or a mine. The data is numeric and requires preprocessing for effective training and testing. Dataset link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Connectionist+Bench+(Sonar,+Mines+vs.+Rocks)



## Contents

The notebook contains the following key sections:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**:
    - Load the sonar dataset.
    - Explore its structure, attributes, and target labels.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Normalize the data to improve model performance.
    - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

3. **Model Implementation**:
    - Train a KNN classifier using the training data.
    - Optimize hyperparameters like the number of neighbors.

4. **Evaluation**:
    - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

5. **Visualization**:
    - Visualize the results to understand the classification boundaries and model effectiveness.


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

## Results

The KNN model achieves 90% accuracy in classifying sonar data (mine or rock)
